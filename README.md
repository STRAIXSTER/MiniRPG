This mini rpg was made as a project for college to test our knowledge in using classes in C++.
I decided that, instead of making a simple and boring library , or shop  or whatever others made, I would make a mini game , using my knowledge of previous projcts i made in my free time.
The program uses automated variables determinated by the computer to decide radomly allocated enemies, gold, xp and damage to the player and enemies.
