This mini rpg was made as a project for college to test our knowledge in using classes in C++.
I decided that, instead of making a simple and boring library , or shop  or whatever others made, I would make a mini game , using my knowledge of previous projcts i made in my free time.
The code has a few inside jokes here and there... but most of the functions are straightfoward.
